### Hi there, my name is Marco Diaz! 👋

**`Software Engineer (Developer/Collaborator/Creator)`**

I'm a software engineer with a passion to build applications from ground up. I focus on making my version of the digital world one line of code at a time. Humbled and open to learning new stacks outside of my confort zone. As a US Army veteran, my experience working with various elite groups has made me the professional I am today. 😁

  <summary><h3>Marco's Coding Journey 💻</h3></summary>
  My journey to become a software engineer began in the military. I enlisted in the US Army as a Human Resource Specialist in 2011. I was introduced to many applications and technologies the military used. I quicked learned and adapted to all applications that I was introduced to so I started developing small applications that made my team and organization's life easier. After 11 years of serving in the military I decided to change career paths to become a full time software engineer. I assessed and graduated from the Galvanize MCSP Immersive coding bootcamp. I learned how to be comfident within myself to research and learn new stacks. I planned and developed with teams to achieve various client based projects using agile methodologies. I was challenged to not only work with my peers but to learn new stacks and learn more about myself and how I can apply my skills to the digital world.
